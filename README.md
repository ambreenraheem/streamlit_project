## By AMBREEN ABDUL RAHEEM (THE DATA ANALYST, AI AGENT AND WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPER)


Building a real-time web application using the Streamlit Python package.

The instructor demonstrates how to create an interactive dashboard that tracks bike and dock availability for Toronto’s Bike Share system by tapping into live API data.

Key features of the app include a color-coded map for station status and a personalized search function that calculates the shortest path to the nearest available bike or empty dock. Beyond technical coding steps involving folium and pandas, the tutorial emphasizes a product-driven mindset, encouraging viewers to focus on user experience and business impact in their data science projects.

The source ultimately highlights Streamlit as a no-cost, highly customizable alternative to traditional dashboarding tools like Tableau or Power BI.
